# expense_tracker
My first project after completing The Odin Project.

Project Title: Expense Tracker

Project Description: This Expense Tracker is a simple, yet useful app that allows the user to track how much money they spend, and what they spend it on. 

I used HTML, CSS and JS to build it. 

I mostly focused on the functionality of the app, not the visuals. I ran into some problems, especially when it came to calculating the total once a new row was added to/or deleted from the table, but I managed to finally figure it out.
